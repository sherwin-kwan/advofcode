# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an [annual challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2021) that runs during the 25 days leading up to Christmas.

## About the Challenges

Each day, a new two-part challenge is posted. The challenges require all kinds of algorithms to solve, but are language-agnostic.

"Showing your work" is not necessary to pass a challenge; however, the solutions are often large numbers which are virtually impossible to brute force, so you do actually have to do the work.

## My Repo

I will be uploading the algorithms I used to solve these challenges as I finish them. I normally do every problem first in Ruby (for speed) and then in another language I want to learn.
