# advofcode-2020

Advent of Code is an [annual challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2020) that runs during the 25 days leading up to Christmas.

Check out my [Medium article](https://sherwinator.medium.com/what-i-learned-from-my-first-advent-of-code-ada891196050) where I comment on AoC 2020 and my thought process for many of these puzzles!

## About the Challenges

Each day, a new two-part challenge is posted. The challenges require all kinds of algorithms to solve, but are language-agnostic.

"Showing your work" is not necessary to pass a challenge; however, the solutions are often large numbers which are virtually impossible to brute force, so you do actually have to do the work.

## My Repo

I will be uploading the algorithms I used to solve these challenges as I finish them. I alternate between using Ruby and JavaScript (the challenges are language-agnostic), and to give myself more practice, I do not use any packages other than the standard library that comes with the language.
